# cpsc121-prelab-script
Prelab script to parse student grades from given Gradescope exported sheet and list of students.

Used for the teaching team for UBC's CPSC 121 course. Note that this is simply my version of the project - an internal version is released on our CPSC 121 git that will be passed forward. However, this is the original version of the script I made. A script was originally created by JR (thank you!) for the teaching team - we lost track of it over time and created a new script inspired by JR's original script.
