# cpsc121-prelab-script
Prelab script to parse student grades from given Gradescope exported sheet and list of students.

Used for the teaching team for UBC's CPSC 121 course. Note that this is simply my version of the project - an internal version is released on our CPSC 121 git that will be passed forward. 

This is the original version of the script made my JR (thank you!), edited to fit the course's evolving needs.

Files are organized as follows:
* parser.js is the code that parses the 
* style.css handles the style of the page
* "CPSC 121 Pre-Lab Grades.html" has the page's HTML layout and interactible elements.
